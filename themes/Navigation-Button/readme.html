  </ul>
  
  <h3>3. What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?</h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests. </em>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			  <strong><em><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></em></strong>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
			</p>
  
			<ul>
	<li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent</li>
	<li><strong>Performance of a Contract. </strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Legitimate Interests. </strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
	
	<ul>
	<li>Ensure the security of user accounts and protect against unauthorized access.</li>
	<li>Improve user experience and provide personalized service by retaining conversation history.</li>
	<li>Enhance the relevance and usefulness of the app's features for each user.</li>
  </ul>
	</li>
  
	<li><strong>Legal Obligations.  </strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
	<li><strong>Vital Interests.   </strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
  
  </ul>
  
  <p>
			  <strong><em><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></em></strong>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
			</p>
			<p>
			In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
			</p>
  
			<ul>
	<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
	<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
	<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
	<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
	<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
  If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
  </li>
	<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
	<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
  </li>
	<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
	<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
	<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
  </ul>

Such an offer wall may appear in our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to other persons and will leave our application(s). A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>5. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information. </em>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"
			</p>
  
			<p>
		   Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="/cp" target="_blank" >Cookie Policy</a>.
			</p>
  
			<h3>6. How do we handle your social logins?</h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you. </em>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
			</p>

			<h3>7. Is your information transferred internationally?</h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own. </em>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			Our servers are located in. If you are accessing our Services from outside, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?" above), in and other countries.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.
			</p>
  
			<h3>8. How long do we keep your information?</h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law. </em>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
			</p>
  
			<h3>9. How do we keep your information safe?</h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures. </em>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
			</p>
  
			<h3>10. What are your privacy rights? </h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence. </em>
			</p>
  
			<p>
			In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability, and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?" below.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			<strong><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u></strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?" below.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
			</p>
  
			<h4>Account Information</h4>
  
			<p>
			If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
			</p>
  
			<ul>
	<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
	<li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
			</p>
  
			<p>
		   <strong><u>Cookies and similar technologies:</u></strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.
			</p>
  
			<h3>11. Controls for do-not-track features:</h3>
  
			<p>
			Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
			</p>
  
			<p>
			California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
			</p>
  
			<h3>12. Do United States residents have specific privacy rights?</h3>
  <p>
			  <strong><em> In Short: </em></strong> <em> If you are a resident of, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information.
