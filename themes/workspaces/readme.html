                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        A workspace is a way to organize and separate your chats, presets, prompts, files, collections, assistants, or tools. By creating separate workspaces, you can keep your tasks and projects neatly categorized and easily accessible without mixing information from different areas.

                        Each workspace can be customized to suit your specific needs. You can change the workspace name, update the workspace image, and modify how the AI interacts with you within that workspace by adjusting its response settings.
