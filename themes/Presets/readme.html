					<h2>Creating a New Preset</h2>
					<p>
						To create a preset, click the "Create Preset" button and fill out the necessary fields. You can give the preset a name, select the AI model, and write a prompt that guides the AI's behavior.
					</p>

					<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
					<p>
						Adjust advanced settings to suit your needs. You can control the temperature, which defines the creativity of the AI, and the context length, which determines how much of the conversation history the AI retains.
					</p>

					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>
						Presets allow for the creation of custom AI configurations, ensuring that tasks and interactions are carried out efficiently and consistently.
